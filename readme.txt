--- Still to do ---

1)  Finish porting all of the chart objects from the Ruby libraries.
2)  Factor out default stylesheets so that individual properties may be overridden without copying the entire stylesheet into another app.
3)  Implement javascript-based animation (See JellyGraph for a Silverlight example of what simple animation can do for a charting library).
4)  Implement namespace-based packages (see http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#namespace-packages)... so that the package is svg.chart.Graph, etc.
